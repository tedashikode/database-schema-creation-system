1. Project Initialization
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Initialize a basic project structure (frontend directory, backend directory).
   - Set up environment variables for AI provider credentials.

2. Frontend Setup
   - Implement a responsive UI based on Figma guidelines.
   - Include a home page with a “Create New Project” feature.
   - Add routing to handle project-specific URLs for schema viewing and editing.

3. Interactive Q&A Interface
   - Implement a dedicated React/Vue/Angular component dedicated to the AI Q&A workflow.
   - Include text input for user answers and a display area for AI-generated questions.
   - Handle loading states, errors, and user feedback during AI calls.

4. Backend & API
   - Set up a Node.js (or preferred language) server with endpoints for AI interactions.
   - Implement logic to process user responses and store them in a data model (SQL or NoSQL depending on justification).
   - Provide endpoints to retrieve projects by unique ID.

5. AI Integration
   - Use an LLM provider’s API to generate the schema based on user conversation flow.
   - Validate user input and handle errors from the AI service.
   - Store the final generated schema in the backend.

6. Schema Storage & Retrieval
   - Choose an appropriate storage solution (e.g., MongoDB for NoSQL or PostgreSQL for SQL).
   - Justify the choice in the documentation.
   - Implement retrieval endpoints to display previous schemas in a project-specific page.

7. Testing & Validation
   - Write basic unit tests and integration tests (frontend and backend).
   - Evaluate the AI flow to confirm questions are relevant and the schema is generated correctly.

8. Documentation
   - Update the ReadME with setup instructions, technology choices, and AI integration details.
   - Provide instructions on how to run the project locally and note any deployment guidelines.
   - Include examples or references for further clarity.

9. Deployment & Demo (Optional)
   - If time permits, deploy the application to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify).
   - Provide a demo link in the ReadME if applicable.

10. Final Submission
   - Confirm the project meets the requirements and deadlines.
   - Submit the GitHub repository link and details via WhatsApp to +1 803 387 6281.
   - Ensure the talent profile on gigsama.com is complete before the deadline.
